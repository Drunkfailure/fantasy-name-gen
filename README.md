# The DnD Name Generator

A fantasy name generator that includes options for many races for the playable and encounterable races you will traditionally find in fantasy media such as human, elf, dwarf, goblin, tiefling, dragonborn. Currently stocked with over 1000 first and last names and growing, with more races to be added soon.
